Case Study: Emotion Detection from Text Messages 

Title: Developing a Neural Network to Detect Emotions in Student Messages

This project focuses on developing a neural network based system for emotion detection from short  English text messages. The primary objective is to identify a single dominant emotion expressed in  each message from predefined categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or neutral.

The system will be trained on text-based inputs.

The scope includes, 
1. Emotion detection in short, sentence-level text inputs. 
2. Analysis of text written only in English. 
3. Use of NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and word embeddings 
(e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe). 
4. Implementation of a neural network architecture, such as an LSTM or feedforward neural 
network, for emotion classification. 
5. Preprocessing and modeling of texts containing only linguistic content, without 
incorporating emojis, images, or audio cues.

TARGET EMOTIONS FOR CLASSIFICATION 
1. Joy - Expressions of happiness, satisfaction, and positive emotions 
2. Sadness - Indicators of depression, disappointment, and negative emotions 
3. Anger - Signs of frustration, irritation, and aggressive emotions 
4. Fear - Expressions of anxiety, worry, and apprehension 
5. Neutral - Balanced or emotionally neutral communications
